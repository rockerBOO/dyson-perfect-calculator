# Dyson Perfect Calculator

Was an idea to create a calculator that would help in making perfect ratio's.

Currently showcases nested recipes and showing the amount needed. 

There are other calculators out there that do most of the calculations to create ratios, so I felt less inclined to make this complete. Might come back later and fill out the rest of the buildings and add a perfect ratio calculator. Or maybe you want to give it a try?
